Today i changed my theme of linux lol uhh... not on my own but well its a accomplishment lets see what i learned and then i will
additionally add what i forgot XD lets goooo
1. pwd- heh sounds like a degree but well its fullform is print working directory.
what is does? it shows where exactly are you and prints the path to you or the place you are in.

2.cd- change directory hmmm... its full form is pretty self explanatory since i take it that directory in linux means
a file/folders idk if im correct but yea lets go with it
what it does? it helps us go to a folder ex:- cd folder_name

3.mkdir- ah this one is easy too it just make a folder at the location where we are currently it stands for makedirectory i think
letss see what else did i know and fumbled up now...

4.nano- idk its full form so ummm it help us edit/write in the file lol im using nano to write it. First time:)

5.touch- touch-grass... ye idk about this ones full form too but what it does?
it just creates a new file where we specify or where we are right now

6.ls- heee this one stands for list hmm wont it be good if it was li? well whatever.
what it does? it print the files that we have inside a directory hmm like opening a door to see what criminals are inside.

ohh how could i forget my favourite question .... whoami .... lol 
it prints my user name like i didnt know it to begin with why does this command even exist maybe i will know i future but 
lets see


Thats all i understand till now lets continue this if i learn something new or info about them today or 
on day 2-- 11.24AM lets see if i comeback.

Im back again 

Now what did i learn?

1.cp - this does the job of copying and pasting of folders/files atleast thats what i used it to do right now...
i will know soon if im correct.

lol i figured out how to open vs code via CLI amazing XD lets get to work now.

// i learned that i can just jump to files by just doing cd /pathToFile/ lol so easy haha.
